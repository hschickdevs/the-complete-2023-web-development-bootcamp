## HTML Basics

### Using Tables for Layout

HTML Tables can be used for layout. The following example shows how to create a 3 column layout.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 2</td>
    <td>Column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
> See the [personal-site](/content/personal-site/index.html) project for an example of this.

### Forms

Forms are used to collect user input. The following example shows a form with a text input and a submit button.

```html
<form>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
> See the [personal-site/contact](/content/personal-site/contact.html) page for an example of forms.
